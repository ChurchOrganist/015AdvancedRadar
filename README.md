Long Range Radar 1.0.0 by Michael Cowgill (ChurchOrganist)

This is simply a port of Malcolm Cooks' AdvancedRadar mod for Factorio 1.0.0
Malcolm's code is almost unchanged apart from some alterations to the sprite definitions, required for compatibility with Factorio's 0.16.x format, and a couple of alterations to the entity.lua file to enable the blue shading in the minimap.
Fast replace and upgrading with upgrade planner has also now been implemented
This has been tested in Sandbox mode and appears to be working OK.
If not please file a bug report at the Github repository.

Hope you enjoy it :)
