015AdvancedRadar 0.15.0 by Michael Cowgill (ChurchOrganist)

This is simply a port of Malcolm Cooks' AdvancedRadar mod for Factorio 0.15.
Malcolm's code is unchanged apart from some minor alterations to the locale files for compatibility with Factorio's 0.15.x format.

This has been tested and appears to be working OK.

Hope you enjoy it :)
