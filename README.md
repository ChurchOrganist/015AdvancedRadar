015AdvancedRadar 0.15.1 by Michael Cowgill (ChurchOrganist)

This is simply a port of Malcolm Cooks' AdvancedRadar mod for Factorio 0.15.
Malcolm's code is almost unchanged apart from some minor alterations to the locale files for compatibility with Factorio's 0.15.x format, and a couple of alterations to the entity.lua file to enable the blue shading in the minimap.

This has been tested and appears to be working OK.

Hope you enjoy it :)
